Hello there! I'm Anna, a passionate Front-End Developer with a strong background in teaching programming. My journey into the programming world started at the Armath Engineering Laboratory. For over 3 years, I've had the privilege of nurturing the minds of children aged 10 to 18, guiding them through the exciting realms of programming, website development, game design, robotics, and 3D modeling.

My dedication to education has been particularly rewarding as I've watched my students not only participate in international Olympiads but also emerge as prize-winners. Their achievements have fueled my commitment to fostering a new generation of tech-savvy innovators.

When I'm not shaping young minds, I'm immersed in crafting responsive websites that seamlessly blend form and function. I'm also intrigued by the world of 3D web development, exploring the possibilities of creating immersive online experiences.

Let's connect and share our insights in the ever-evolving field of Front-End Development. I'm excited to continue my journey of learning, teaching, and creating impactful digital solutions.
